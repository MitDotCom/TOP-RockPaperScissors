# TOP-RockPaperScissors
From TOP Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is the first JavaScript program project in TOP Foundations JavaScript section.

The link for this site can be found at: https://mitdotcom.github.io/TOP-RockPaperScissors/

08/28/23 This is the first iteration: a Chrome Dev Tools Console based game.

09/03/23 I completed the first iteration. I learned that I need to further study the JavaScript logical operators: && and || I got the code to work (around line 140 or so I believe in the playAgain() function) but I don't understand why.

09/22/23 I just created a new branch 'rps-ui' as per TOP. Very exciting. Time to start working on a revised UI version of my game!

10/21/23 I finished a basic state of the site with a basically functional script to play the game a couple days ago. Now I am adding style to it. And I will iron out the bugs in the game, as well as change the score read out and such.

10/23/23 I finished the project by adding sound and polishing up some of the styles. I am happy with the project. I learned about Event Listeners which is what took me so long. But I think it was very worth it.
