# TOP-RockPaperScissors
From TOP Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is the first JavaScript program project in TOP Foundations JavaScript section.

08/28/23 This is the first iteration: a Chrome Dev Tools Console based game.

09/03/23 I completed the first iteration. I learned that I need to further study the JavaScript logical operators: && and || I got the code to work (around line 140 or so I believe in the playAgain() function) but I don't understand why.

09/22/23 I just created a new branch 'rps-ui' as per TOP. Very exciting. Time to start working on a revised UI version of my game!
